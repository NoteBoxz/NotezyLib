# Notezy Lib

A Lethal Company Library mod, made for adding special mechanics to Custom Moons.

## Features

> ### Multi Dungeon Generator
Allows for custom moons to have more than one interior generated
(Does not support fire exits)
To set it up, go to the top toolbars, click on Tools -> NotezyLib -> Set Up Multi-Dungeon
All settings are option, (aside from the extra dungon count)

> ### Thats it!
Aside from some occasinal scripts I've moved from my moons to this lib for later use, 
the Multi Dungeon Generator is the biggest thing this lib has to offer so far.
