# Notezy Lib

A Lethal Company library mod for adding special mechanics to custom moons.

## Features

> ### Multi-Dungeon Generator
Allows custom moons to have more than one interior generated (currently does not support fire exits).

For developers: to set it up, go to the top menu and click Tools -> NotezyLib -> Set Up Multi-Dungeon. All settings are optional (aside from the extra dungeon count).

> ### That's it!
Aside from some occasional scripts I've moved from my moons to this lib for later use, the Multi-Dungeon Generator is the biggest feature this lib has to offer so far.
